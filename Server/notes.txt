To access virtual enviroment in terminal type cd (drag and drop folder into terminal)
To upgrade the virtual enviroment use 
    update: py -m pip install --upgrade pip

To create a virtual enviroment we need to 
    install: py -m pip install virtualenv
Now that we have found the virtual enviroment libary, we want to create a virtual enviroment
    py -m venv (name of a folder)
Now we need to activate the virtual enviroment 
    mac users: source venv/bin/activate
    window users: venv\Scripts\activate
***REMEMBER YOU NEED TO LOCATED IN THE FOLDER OF THE PROJECT***\

Install flask in venv
    py -m pip install flask
How to check the flask version
    flask --version

Flask creates a API ==> establishes a connection between computer and server

Creating a API (Application Programming Interface)
You have to import flask libary (from flask import Flask)
Create a application 
    app = Flask(__name__) this means getting the name from root of the project
